# BLOCKCHAIN WITH PYTHON

CASE STUDY: As a FinTech Engineer for renowned Financial Institution, I need to build a Blockchain-based Ledger System with a user-friendly Web Interface. This ledger should allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.
